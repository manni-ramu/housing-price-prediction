Housing Machine Learning Project
Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting housing prices based on various features and data. The model utilizes historical housing data to train and learn patterns, enabling it to make accurate predictions on the prices of new or unseen properties. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation stages to create a robust and reliable housing price prediction system.

Project Structure
The project is organized into several components:

Data Collection: Gathering relevant housing data from various sources, such as real estate websites, public datasets, or APIs. This data should include features such as location, size, number of rooms, amenities, and historical sales prices.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the collected data for analysis. This stage involves handling missing values, removing outliers, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Selecting and creating meaningful features that can enhance the predictive power of the model. This may involve transforming existing features, extracting additional information from raw data, or combining multiple features to generate new ones.

Model Selection: Identifying the most suitable machine learning algorithm for the housing price prediction task. Consideration should be given to factors such as model complexity, interpretability, and performance metrics.

Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the chosen model on the available features and their corresponding target variable (housing prices). The model learns the underlying patterns and relationships in the data during this stage.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model by evaluating its predictions on the testing set. Various metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared, can be used to measure the model's accuracy and generalization ability.

Model Deployment: Integrating the trained model into a usable system or application where users can input property details, and the model provides a predicted price as an output. This deployment stage may involve creating a user interface, setting up APIs, or building a web application.
